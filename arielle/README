conservation analysis

Evolutionary conservation slightly higher for mutated positions in hsp90 dependent clients than hsp90 inhibited clients

Residual scores are more negative for c-terminal catalytic domain positions, 
indicating that mutating c-terminal residues in the catalytic domain promotes  hsp90 dependency 

Residual scores are very positive for n-terminal of catalytic domain positions,
indicating that mutating n-terminal residues in the catalytic domain causes c-src to become hsp90 inhibited.
